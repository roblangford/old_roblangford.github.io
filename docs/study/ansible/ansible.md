# Ansible
Currently I am looking into Ansible and Ansible Tower (AWX) for deployment and configuration management in both Linux and Windows.



## Ansible Tower (AWX)

Redhat Ansible Tower is a centralised control system for managing complex deployments, configuration and inventory of software. It can simplfy the processes and management via jobs and runbooks.

There is an opensource edition of Tower called AWX, currently test this out but more details can be found: [Ansible AWX (GitHub)](https://github.com/ansible/awx)
